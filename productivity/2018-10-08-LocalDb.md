# Installation

It's a feature of [SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
Make sure to select it during installation using the **Express Advanced** or **LocalDb** packages.  
It can also be installed with the **Visual Studio Installer**. There it is a part of the **.NET desktop development** workload.
